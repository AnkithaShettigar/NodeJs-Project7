                describe:"A training bench is an adjustable platform used for performing weight training exercises."  ,
                descr:"A weight bench serves as the station to perform many basic weight-training exercises, like bench presses and dumbbell and core work, to name a few. Having a bench at home saves you from playing musical chairs (benches?) with ten other sweaty gym patrons, limiting your actual time spent working out. And owning the right home-gym equipment is crucial to making sure your routine is as safe and effective as possible — especially when weights are involved. A good weight bench should have a firm, supportive cushion — not a plush one that will sink in when you sit or lie down on your back. While ultimately it comes down to preference, we think the best weight benches offer a Goldilocks-type option: a pad thats firm (but not so stiff that it feels like plywood), yet cushioned enough to provide comfort for longer sessions.",

                  descr:"Out of all possible pieces of gym equipment, dumbbells are some of the most versatile, compact, and affordable. You can buy individual pairs of dumbbells, as well as sets of dumbbells. Buying a full set can be a convenient and less expensive way to build out your home gym, as many brands sell packages of dumbbells at a lower rate than it would cost to buy an equal number of pairs individually.With such a wide variety of dumbbell sets out there (hex-shaped, round, rubber-coated, adjustable, etc.), it can be hard to decide which set is right for you. If you are on the hunt for a great set of dumbbells, but have no idea where to start, we've got you covered. We've scoured the market for some of the best sets for homes, value, and even heavy lifters. ",

                  descr:"“A kettlebell is a full-body workout,” says fitness coach Eric Guilmette. “A swing will work hamstrings, glutes, lower back and shoulders. Most of the movements are multi-joint movements and will work multiple muscle groups.While the kettlebell I got was smaller than I'd expected, I've actually come to incorporate kettlebell routines into my workouts regularly, even if I bucket it alongside my other routines and not in replacement of them. If you're likewise looking for a kettlebell, you'll notice that there are many options out there, and a lot of them look nearly identical. After all, the kettlebell design is ubiquitous for the most part.",

                  descr:"Whether you prefer doing pullups or chinups, you'll need a solid bar that can bear your weight. And while any gym worth the price of admission probably has tons of spots for you to work on, investing in a pullup bar for your home gym space or even as one of a few strategic pieces of gear for your home is a great way to get stronger. Most fit right on a doorway, so you can get a quick pump anytime. (Wonder whether pullups or chinups are better for building bigger arms? A top trainer has the answer.)There's no doubt that both pulling moves will help you get serious gains using just your body weight.Generally, lifters will find that the chinup is easier than the pullup. The reasoning for this is that with higher biceps brachii activity, the shoulder-arm-forearm complex can be utilized slightly better than in the pullup,",

                  descr:"A treadmill is a device generally used for walking, running, or climbing while staying in the same place. Treadmills were introduced before the development of powered machines to harness the power of animals or humans to do work, often a type of mill operated by a person or animal treading the steps of a treadwheel to grind grain. In later times, treadmills were used as punishment devices for people sentenced to hard labor in prisons. The terms treadmill and treadwheel were used interchangeably for the power and punishment mechanisms. More recently, treadmills have instead been used as exercise machines for running or walking in one place. Rather than the user powering a mill, the device provides a moving platform with a wide conveyor belt driven by an electric motor or a flywheel. The belt moves to the rear, requiring the user to walk or run at a speed matching the belt.",

It includes a saddle, pedals, and some form of handlebars arranged as on a (stationary) bicycle.A stationary bicycle is usually a special-purpose exercise machine resembling a bicycle without wheels.[4] It is also possible to adapt an ordinary bicycle for stationary exercise by placing it on bicycle rollers or a trainer. Rollers and trainers are often used by racing cyclists to warm up before racing, or to train on their own machines indoors.Some models feature handlebars that are connected to the pedals so that the upper body can be exercised along with the lower body. Most exercise bikes provide a mechanism for applying resistance to the pedals which increases the intensity of the exercise. ",

            descr:"Curd and yogurt: the two terms have often been considered to be synonymous. However, you will be surprised to know that they are in fact, different from each other. Curd or dahi is a dairy product which is made by curdling milk with edible acidic substance like lemon juice, vinegar and even curd itself. All you need to do is add a spoonful of curd or a few drops of a lemon juice or tsp of vinegar in warm milk, and let it stay. It takes around 6 to 8 hours for the milk to turn into curd. Yogurt, on the other hand, is created by bacterial fermentation of milk. To make yogurt, yogurt culture consisting Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophiles is used.

              descr:"When it comes to eating more produce, you can't go wrong. Long story short: Every single fruit (and vegetable!) is a great option. Research has shown eating a minimum of four to five servings per day helps to boost mood and reduce your risk of heart disease, obesity and type 2 diabetes. Yet according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), only 10% of Americans eat enough fruit — about 1½ to 2 cups daily. Many of us also miss out on sufficient dietary fiber, calcium, potassium and magnesium, all of which are found in abundance in produce. Potassium, for example, helps maintain a healthy blood pressure and you'll get it easily in bananas, prunes and cantaloupe. The fiber in fruit also supports better digestion and fills you up for fewer calories, making it a smart choice for your health overall and can help if you're trying to lose weight.",
